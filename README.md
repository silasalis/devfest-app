Hello World!

Current progress
---
Work was started by [Alex Korovyansky](http://github.com/korovyansk) at August 2, 2014. 

Basic modification is [already](https://github.com/GDGOmsk/devfest-app/commit/52066ba5ef8fa013dd0661fda9681fd332f83002) [done](https://github.com/GDGOmsk/devfest-app/releases). Also here in GDG Omsk several Android devs have expressed interest in contribution to the project. So we have nice roadmap for [August](https://github.com/GDGOmsk/devfest-app/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3AAugust+sort%3Acreated-asc)!

Contibution
---
If someone is interested to help, feel free to resolve [Issues](https://github.com/GDGOmsk/devfest-app/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+sort%3Acreated-asc) and send Pull Requests. 

Also we would be happy to get feedback from DevFest organizers about which features would be useful inside DevFest App. The best way for feedback is creation of [new issue](https://github.com/GDGOmsk/devfest-app/issues/new) with suggestion of a feature. For example, for our event we found very useful to make funny [slot machine](https://github.com/GDGOmsk/devfest-app/issues/14), to get a chance for app users to win invites to DevFest Omsk.

Notices for Contributors
--- 
One commit should be very accurate solution of one issue, it would be very useful, when we will move from App for GDG DevFest Omsk to Template App for GDG DevFests.
